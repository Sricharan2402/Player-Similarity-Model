# Player Similarity and Interpolation Model using Clustering:
---

Player Similarity Model:
    A model that is used to find players, similar to the given player based on various stats and features using clustering and cosine similarity.
Player Interpolation Model:
    A model capable of combining existing stats and features of two different players and finding players similar to the combined profile.

## Environment:

* Coded in Python 3.8
* This was trained in a cloud runtime (Colab).

## Code folder structure:

* **data** - has the master and supporting databases.
* **model.ipynb** - has the models.


## Instructions to run code:

* Run ```pip install matplotlib numpy pandas sklearn soccerplots``` to install the required dependencies.
* Open ```model.ipynb``` to get an interactive iterface of the model.
